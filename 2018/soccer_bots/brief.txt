The goal here is to make Soccer playing robots, we are permitted to create two robots; a defender and an attacker.

Sensors: 

Do we want to interface with the default lego sensors using Arduino, or do you want to buy arduino components and use them instead? 

What are the benefits of using the default lego sensors? 

How do we interface with these sensors?


The sensors that we should plan to use: 

[] InfraRed Sensors

[] Colour Sensors

[] Compass sensors

[] Ultra-sonic sensors (for detecting the walls?) 

Are there any real benefits of having a touch sensor to detect when we have 'captured' the ball? 

Design:

What shape robot should we create? We are permitted to create any robot within the 22cm diameter.


Do we want to use omni-directional wheels? How many? What is the minimum number of wheels?

How should we construct the chassis? We could purchase a premade base from online, or we could 3d-print/laser-cut the chassis.

Laser-cutting has the benefit of fast production, and the ease of working with wood (being able to drill holes rapidly to attatch sensors etc)

3d printing allows for more complex shapes, it offers strength, but it takes many hours to produce and is tricky to work with after-the-fact (plastic is brittle)

Are we going to have a multi-layered design?

How will the robot be powered?? We will need a product called a 'buck-boost' converter, which takes in any voltage and converts it to an adjustable threshold (to run the arduinos/motors)

What sized motors will we use? We want the perfect compromise between torque and speed, because as the speed increases the torque decreases. 

Will we gear the motors down? Research some possible motors we could use...
